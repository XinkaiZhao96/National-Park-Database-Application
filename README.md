# National Park Database Application

## Project Summary

The main goal of this project is to build a web application in which users can retrieve information about national parks in the USA according to their needs. In the backend, we will create the database consisting of datasets collected from the National Park Service website. The database is relational, including the Alerts table, Events table, Visitor Centers, and Parks table which are referenced to each other by the key “park_id”. Creatively, we add a comment section to allow users to upload, edit, and delete their posts. To ensure that the application works efficiently and stably, we implement diverse operations to the database like join, aggregation, and CRUD.
